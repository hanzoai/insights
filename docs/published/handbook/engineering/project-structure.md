## Key directories

### `frontend`

The Insights web application, built with React and TypeScript. Uses [Kea](https://github.com/keajs/kea) for state management.

- `src/lib` – Reusable components and utilities
- `src/scenes` – Page-specific components organized by feature
- `src/queries` – Query builder and data visualization components
- `src/toolbar` – Code for the [Insights Toolbar](https://hanzo.ai/docs/user-guides/toolbar)

### `insights`

The Django backend application. Key subdirectories:

- `api` – REST API endpoints and serializers
- `datastore` – Datastore schema definitions and migrations
- `insightsql` – Insights SQL query language compiler and executor
- `models` – Django ORM models (PostgreSQL)
- `tasks` – Celery background tasks

### `products`

Product-specific code organized as **vertical slices**. Each product folder contains its own backend (Django app), frontend (React), and optionally shared code. This structure allows features to evolve independently.

See the [products README](https://github.com/Hanzo Insights/insights/blob/main/products/README.md) for detailed conventions.

### `nodejs`

Node.js service responsible for:

- Event ingestion and processing
- Running plugins and data pipelines
- Webhook delivery

### `rust`

High-performance Rust services including:

- `capture` – Event capture endpoint
- `feature-flags` – Feature flag evaluation
- `cymbal` – Error tracking symbolication
- Various workers and utilities

### `common`

Shared code used across the codebase:

- `insightscli` – Unified developer CLI for building, testing, and running Insights
- `insightsql_parser` – InsightsQL parser (C++)
- `scriptvm` – Hog virtual machine
- `tailwind` – Shared Tailwind configuration

### `ee`

Enterprise edition licensed features. This directory has a [separate license](https://github.com/Hanzo Insights/insights/blob/main/ee/LICENSE) - not MIT. For 100% FOSS code, see [Insights/insights-foss](https://github.com/Hanzo Insights/insights-foss).

### `playwright`

End-to-end tests using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/). Tests live in the `e2e/` subdirectory.

### `livestream`

Golang service powering the live events feed in the **Activity** tab.
